          <p>
            I am Kellen. I'm in my senior year and I'm loving it. I love listening to music and I listen to all types.
            My goats include Chris B, Adriano R, and Pedro N.

        <h2>My Choose-Your-Own Adventure Project</h2>
        <a href="https://iacs-cs.github.io/choose-your-own-adventure-kellboss9/">Choose your school day</a>
        <p>
          This was my first project and I had a lot of fun on it 9/10. So much fun 
          that I actually turned it in a little late due to all the stuff I decided to add to it...

        <h2>My Business Card Project</h2>
        <a href="https://iacs-cs.github.io/business-card-project-kell-and-wes/">pokemon card pack opening business card</a>
        <p>
          Definitely the worst project. I was confused and it wasn't any fun. 3/10 would not do it again.

      <h2>My Zen Garden Project</h2>
      <a href="https://iacs-zen-garden.netlify.app/#kellboss9--style">the hell of web design zen garden</a>
      <p>
        I enjoyed this project a lot more than the business card project. This is my favorite project and even 
        though it is not the easiest to read its all by design. I wanted to add embers that emit from the text as 
        well but I didn't have time. 10/10 would do it again.
      </p>
      <h2>My Design Improvement Project</h2>
        <a href="https://iacs-cs.github.io/design-improvement-project-kellboss9/">Fixing the Lost and Found slide</a>
        <p>
        Besides what you are looking at now, this was my last project. I was tasked with 
        upgrading a poor design to be more effective at what it was trying to convey. 
        It was pretty fun and I enjoyed the challenge. 8/10 would do it again.
      </p>
      <h2>My interactive design</h2>
      <a href="https://iacs-cs.github.io/interactive-design-weston/">My school quiz</a>
      <p>
        10/10. This was pretty difficult because it was the first to use javascript but it was 
      so fun. I loved being able to make something that was interactive and interesting. I would 
      absolutely do it again and might try this on my own.

          Used AI to make the two background images within this portfolio 
          as well as the color changing button and <span class="line">end my suffering</span> delete 
          it all button (because java script is still pretty confusing!)
