          <p>
            I am Kellen. I'm in my senior year and I'm loving it. I love listening to music and I listen to all types.
            My goats include Chris B, Adriano R, and Pedro N.

        <h2>My Choose-Your-Own Adventure Project</h2>
        <a href="https://iacs-cs.github.io/choose-your-own-adventure-kellboss9/choose your school day">Choose your school day</a>
        <p>
          This was my first project and I had a lot of fun on it 9/10. So much fun 
          that I actually turned it in a little late due to all the stuff I decided to add to it...

        <h2>My Business Card Project</h2>
        <a href="https://iacs-cs.github.io/business-card-project-kell-and-wes/">pokemon card pack opening business card</a>
        <p>
          Definitely the worst project. I was confused and it wasn't any fun. 3/10 would not do it again.

      <h2>My Zen Garden Project</h2>
      <a href="https://iacs-cs.github.io/zen-garden-kellboss9/">the hell of web design zen garden</a>
      <p>
        I enjoyed this project a lot more than the business card project. This is my favorite project and even 
        though it is not the easiest to read its all by design. I wanted to add embers that emit from the text as 
        well but I didn't have time. 10/10 would do it again.

        <h2>Sources &amp; Attribution</h2>
        <p>
          Fix me... you can add a list of sources you used to create your
          portfolio here. Be sure to acknowledge any images, fonts, or other
          media you used that you did not create yourself.

        <p>
          In addition, remember if you use AI to help (including Copilot), you
          must acknowledge it here with a description of how you used AI &mdash;
          you can list tasks AI helped you with, and you should also include
          notes <em>in your source code</em> describing any AI-generated code.
